Big Eng Little Eng is a mentorship program destined for first-year students to assist them with their transition to university in which students get paired with an upper-year student in their corresponding engineering program.
It provides students with an opportunity for networking and offers access to a wide variety of online tools and resources to help first-years adjust to university workload.
This initiative also includes bonding exercises and social events between mentors and mentees because there isn't just limited to studying.

(Second-year students and above qualify as Big Eng)
